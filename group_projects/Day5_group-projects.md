# Group Projects

## Background

You have just completed the Wellcome Connecting Science PRS course and are now acquainted with tools such as PRSice, PRSCSx, and BRIDGEPRS, which claim to improve PRS prediction in Africans. You are now getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools to test out and do not know which tool to use for your PRS project, which involves continental Africans. You decide to read more, and you then stumble across a novel approach called PRSmix (shown below) by Troung et al.(2024), which integrates PRSs developed using diverse methods, forming an integrated PRS that has been noted to outperform previously reported PRS, as shown below. This seems as a much more pragmatic approach, and you are eager to apply it to your PRS projects.

## Questions
 **Q1. Applicability of PRSmix** <br>
Do you think the PRSmix approach is likely to perform well in continental African populations? Why or why not?<br>

 **Q2. Evaluation of PRSmix Performance** <br>
 How well did the PRSmix-derived PRS perform in your assigned dataset? <br>

  **Q3. Comparison with PGS Catalog Scores** <br>
  How does the PRSmix-derived PRS compare to the individual PRS scores from the PGS Catalog in terms of predictive performance for your dataset? <br>

  **Q4. Interpretation and Limitations** <br>
  What do your results suggest about the utility of polygenic scores for this trait in African populations? <br>


## Analytical datasets
 **Group 1** Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/hba1cdta.txt<br> 
 **Group 2** Insulin reistance (HOMA_IR) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/homairdta.txt<br>
 **Group 3** OGTT 2hr glucose https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/2hrglcdta.txt<br> 
 **Group 4** Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) https://github.com/tinashedoc/cvx/blob/main/satdta.txt<br>

 ## Milestones to guide with project completion
 **1.** Assign tasks and roles to group members to tackle the project ensuring the tasks can be completed in parallel by Tuesday.<br>
 **2.** Ensure you complete Qn 1 and Qn 2 by Wednesday as these do not require  data analysis.<br>
 **3.** You need to write up and finalise the analysis plan by Thursday.<br>
 **4.** Run the analysis and finalise your work for presentation on Friday.<br>
